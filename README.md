# Sahayak---Helping-Hands
Sahayak - Helping Hands is an innovative Android and web-based application designed to bridge the communication gap between undertrials and legal authorities. The project aims to streamline the process of managing and monitoring cases while ensuring that undertrials receive adequate legal support and rehabilitation opportunities. Sahayak leverages modern technologies to create a unified platform that connects jail authorities, lawyers, judges, and NGOs, providing an efficient and transparent system for case management and communication.

The application includes features such as creating and managing undertrial profiles, which store detailed information about past records, charges, and case statuses. An AI-powered chatbot enables real-time interaction between undertrials and lawyers through chat, call, or video conferencing, ensuring seamless communication and accessibility. A machine learning-based recommendation system is integrated to assign suitable advocates based on the specific needs and circumstances of each undertrial.

Additionally, Sahayak provides a virtual platform for NGOs and pro bono lawyers to register and connect with undertrials, encouraging social responsibility and collaboration. The dashboard feature tracks and monitors case progress in real-time, offering valuable insights and updates to jail authorities, legal representatives, and judiciary members. The platform also includes e-counseling and rehabilitation programs to support the mental well-being and reintegration of undertrials into society.

By digitizing the communication and case management processes, Sahayak simplifies workflows, reduces delays, and enhances transparency across all stakeholders. The project has the capacity to support 100+ users and incorporates multi-language support to ensure accessibility for individuals from diverse backgrounds. Sahayak represents a significant step forward in improving the efficiency and equity of the legal support system for undertrials.
